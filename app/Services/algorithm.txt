Repeat until no more sections:
    1: Get a section, its teaching faculty, and its courses
    2: Compute the total credit hours for this section
    3: Compute the classes per week for this section (total credits / no of weekdays)

    Repeat until no more credit hours:
        4: Select a faculty with an unallocated course
        5: If the current room is not free on the given day and time, check the next time
           slot. If it is not free on the whole day, check the next room.
        6: Check if the section and faculty is also free on this day and time. If not,
           check the next time slot. If they are not free on the whole day, check
           the next room.
        7: Reserve the free classroom with the given day, time and faculty
        8: If we have allocated classes = classes per week, go to the next day. If we are
           on the last day (Friday), keep allocating (generally lesser classes would
           be allocated on Friday because of ceil() on classes per week calculation).
